                Welcome to Uncommon Hacks, the official hackathon
                of the University of Chicago! Spend 24 hours working
                on a project and meeting cool people in this
                one-of-a-kind experience! In our 2024 edition of Hacks, 
                we're excited to bring you the biggest event since the 
                pandemic, including the overnight component that makes 
                for a truly unforgettable experience.

                Although Hacks will have prizes, we place more emphasis on
                learning and collaboration than some kind of competitive
                aspect. So, even if you've never coded before, please do
                sign up! A successful Hacks team needs people with
                different skill sets, and if you would like to learn how to
                code, we'll have workshops to help you do so.
